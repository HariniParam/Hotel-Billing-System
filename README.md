# Hotel-Billing-System
--The hotel billing system utilizes an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to manage the menu efficiently. 
--It stores menu items where each node contains details such as item code, name, and price. 
--This structure ensures quick retrieval of items based on their unique codes when users place orders. 
--The AVL tree's balanced nature optimizes search, insertion, and deletion operations, enabling seamless order placement and effective menu management within the system.
